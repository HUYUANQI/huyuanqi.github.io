            <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>
            <div class="intro">
                <p>This design project establishes a dedicated creative space for children, aimed at supporting their innate freedom of expression while maintaining household order and aesthetics. The central objective is to create an environment that encourages children to engage in drawing and exploration without fear of damaging the home setting. By offering autonomy in selecting drawing mediums and involving children in the assembly process, the design strengthens creativity, independence, and experiential learning. Ultimately, the project provides a comprehensive solution that integrates developmental, educational, and environmental benefits.</p>

            <h3>Key Features and Outcomes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Designated Drawing Environment</strong><br>
                    A physical space equipped with customizable drawing boards (e.g., magnetic, chalkboard, or modular panels) that channels children's creativity into a safe and constructive outlet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Child Autonomy and Participation</strong><br>
                    Children are encouraged to select their preferred medium and actively participate in the setup process, fostering ownership, responsibility, and agency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Parental Guidance and Protection</strong><br>
                    The design incorporates gentle boundaries to guide children's early scribbling, preventing damage to household walls and reducing parental cleaning burdens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Educational and Developmental Value</strong><br>
                    The structured yet flexible system supports the development of fine motor skills, confidence, and aesthetic awareness, while simultaneously enhancing family interaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Household Aesthetic Enhancement</strong><br>
                    Children's drawings are integrated into the home as meaningful decorative expressions, transforming what might be seen as disorderly scribbling into an element of visual charm.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Future Development</h3>
            <p>Looking forward, the design holds potential for integration with digital and interactive technologies. For instance, programming frameworks such as <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> could be employed to extend the system into virtual drawing platforms or hybrid environments. Through web-based interfaces, children could store, display, or share their drawings digitally, creating a bridge between physical and digital creativity. Future iterations may also incorporate data visualization, interactive feedback, or augmented reality features, allowing children's artistic expressions to evolve dynamically in both tangible and virtual spaces. Such developments would further expand the educational, aesthetic, and participatory dimensions of the design, aligning it with contemporary digital learning environments.</p>
